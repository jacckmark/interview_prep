# QUICK SORT

1. Quick sort - just like merge sort, quickSort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot (pivot should be picked carefully to avoid problems with sorting). The key process in quickSort is a partition(). The target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of an array as the pivot, put x at its correct position in a sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x.

2. Big O - we are not creating the new items here so we are not duplicating data. Thus space complexity for this algorithm is O(1) (so for space complexity this is better algorithm then merge sort). Time complexity is on the other hand O(n $log{n}$) (we had for loop going over whole array and we divided it few times, so we had essentially O(n) and O($log{n}$) these two merged together give us O(n $log{n}$)). There is also a case when we have pivot that will not move and divide our array (for example chosen pivot is already the smallest number in array), we would then have O($n^2$) time complexity, because we would have to compare all the items and we just lost our advantage in quicksort which is the dividing of target array, that's why when choosing pivot we need to be careful and we should be sure that given list even needs sorting (sorted or almost sorted list would be also problematic for this algorithm).
