# MERGE SORT

1. Merge sort - is a sorting algorithm that works by dividing an array into smaller sub-arrays, sorting each sub-array, and then merging the sorted sub-arrays back together to form the final sorted array. In simple terms, we can say that the process of merge sort is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves back together. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

2. Big O - one thing that you might wonder is what is the specialty of this algorithm. We already have a number of sorting algorithms then why do we need this algorithm? One of the main advantages of merge sort is that it has a time complexity of O(n $log{n}$) (for example you will have 3 dividing steps in array of 8 items but you will also have to merge these divided pieces together later on), which means it can sort large arrays relatively quickly. It is also a stable sort, which means that the order of elements with equal values is preserved during the sort. One thing to consider is also space complexity (we continuously create new arrays that need to be stored somewhere) which in case of merge sort is O(n) (where n is the number of items in our initial array).
